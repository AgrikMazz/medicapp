Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy drugs con- sidering many factors, among them being the patient’s height and weight. Chemotherapy may be given by one or more of the following methods: • orally • by injection • through a catheter or port • topically GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 740 Chemotherapy Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form a pill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and can usually be done at home. Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a vein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand or lower arm. The needle is usually attached to a small tube called a catheter, which delivers the drug to the needle from an IV bag or bottle. Intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into a muscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injection is absorbed into the blood more slowly than IV chemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IM chemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy given intravenously. Chemotherapy may also be injected sub- cutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin. Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer is called intralesional (IL) injection. Chemotherapy may also be given by a catheter or port permanently inserted into a central vein or body cav- ity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is placed in a vein or under the skin in the area where the drug will be given. These methods eliminate the need for repeated injections and may allow patients to spend less time in the hospital while receiving chemotherapy. A common location for a permanent catheter is the external jugular vein in the neck. Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is administered into the abdominal cavity through a catheter or port. Chemotherapy given by catheter or port into the spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administra- tion. Catheters and ports may also be placed in the chest cavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location of the cancer to be treated.\n",

Most chemothera- py drugs interfere with the ability of cells to grow or mul- tiply. Although these drugs affect all cells in the body, many useful treatments are most effective against rapidly growing cells. Cancer cells grow more quickly than most other body cells. Other cells that grow fast are cells of the bone marrow that produce blood cells, cells in the stom- ach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. There- fore, the most common side effects of chemotherapy are linked to their effects on other fast growing cells. Types of chemotherapy drugs Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are described below: • Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking DNA, the genetic material of the genes. Cyclophos- phamide is an alkylating drug. • Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA and keep cells from growing and multiplying. An example of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). • Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural sub- stances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with important cell functions, including production of DNA and cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin belong to this group of chemotherapy drugs. • Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally. Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids obtained from the periwinkle plant. • Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers that depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone estrogen for growth. Combination chemotherapy Chemotherapy is usually given in addition to other cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation therapy. When given with other treatments, it is called adjuvant chemotherapy. An oncologist decides which chemothera- py drug or combination of drugs will work best for each patient. The use of two or more drugs together often works better than a single drug for treating cancer. This is called combination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different drug combinations help doctors learn which combinations work best for each type of cancer.\n",
      "[S: S_97fe606b7d284510ad9abed50c9f35bf] Chemotherapy aims to cure cancer by killing cells, and may be used with surgery to prevent cancer spread, with various possible treatment outcomes.\n",
      "[H: H_2] Cancer diagnosis and treatment involve various procedures and approaches. Diagnosis includes blood tests, imaging, and biopsies, while treatment options comprise surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, and palliative care. Surgery aims to remove tumors, while chemotherapy and radiation destroy cancer cells or slow tumor growth. Immunotherapy, including interferons and monoclonal antibodies, also targets cancer cells. Side effects of treatment, such as nausea, hair loss, and bone marrow suppression, are common but often manageable. Palliative care focuses on alleviating symptoms and improving quality of life. A multidisciplinary approach, involving oncologists, surgeons, and other healthcare professionals, is essential for effective cancer management.\n",

These proto- cols usually have strict admission criteria that may exclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat- ment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune cells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells. Preparation For all treatment modalities imaging studies, biopsy, and constant blood analysis is essential before, during, and after treatments. Surgical candidates should undergo extensive pre-operative evaluation with imaging studies, blood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, and readiness of staff for any potential complications and cell biopsy analysis. Patients with other pre-existing chronic disease may require intensive post-operative monitoring. For radiotherapy, the patient undergoes extensive imag- ing studies. Additional planning strategies include beam KEY TERMS Bone marrow suppression—A decrease in cells responsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygen and those responsible for normal blood clotting. DNA—The molecule responsible for cell multipli- cation. Titrate—To analyze the best end point (for dose) for a medication. localization to spare normal tissues, calibration of fractionat- ed doses, and specific positioning during treatment sessions. Patients who receive curative chemotherapy should be informed of possible side effects associated with the chemotherapeutic agent. Patients should also be informed of temporary lifestyle changes and medications that may offer some symptomatic relief. Patients undergoing biologic therapies are usually advised of potential side effects, treatment cycles and specific tests for monitoring progress according to the specific research protocol. Aftercare Patients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud- ies, blood analysis, physical examination, and health improvement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe- cific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi- cal patients may require closer observation during the ini- tial post-operative period to avoid potential complica- tions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered to improve appearance and restore function. Certain surgical procedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves- sels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site. Risks Surgical risks Surgical therapy can be both disfiguring and dis- abling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affected by radiotherapy.\n",

Studies have shown that eating a diet rich in fiber as found in fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise and a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the risk of endometrial, breast, and colon cancer. Certain drugs, which are currently being used for treatment, could also be suitable for prevention. For example, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has been very effective against breast cancer, is currently being tested by the National Cancer Institute for its ability to prevent cancer. Similarly, retinoids derived from vitamin A are being tested for their ability to slow the progression or prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies have suggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas where soil and foods are rich in the mineral selenium. More tri- als are needed to explain these intriguing connections. Prognosis “Lifetime risk” is the term that cancer researchers use to refer to the probability that an individual over the course of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from it. In the United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk of developing cancer, and for women the risk is one in three. Overall, African-Americans are more likely to develop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also 30% more likely to die of cancer than whites. Most cancers are curable if detected and treated at their early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affected by many factors, particularly the type of cancer the patient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which it has metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. In addition, the patient’s age, general health status and the effectiveness of the treatment being pursued are also important factors.\n",

Some widespread, fast- growing cancers are more difficult to treat. In these cases, chemotherapy may slow the growth of the cancer cells. Doctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by the results of medical tests. Physical examination, blood tests, and x rays are all used to check the effects of treat- ment on the cancer. The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are: • Complete remission or response. The cancer complete- ly disappears. The course of chemotherapy is complet- ed and the patient is tested regularly for a recurrence. • Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in size but does not disappear. The same chemotherapy may be continued or a different combination of drugs may be tried. • Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink. Other therapy options may be explored. A tumor may stay stabilized for many years. • Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other thera- py options may be explored. • A secondary malignancy may develop from the one being treated, and that second cancer may need addi- tional chemotherapy or other treatment.

Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do not prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat people who already have the disease. Cancer vaccines work by boosting the body’s immune system and training the immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells. Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is standard treatment for some types of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow faster in the presence of particular hormones. These include cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor- mone therapy involves blocking the production or action of these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumor slows down and survival may be extended for several months or years. Bone marrow transplantation The bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi- ties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bone marrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supply and is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs or radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroys bone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthy cells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrow transplant is the removal of marrow from one person and the transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the same person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans- plantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to “rescue” a patient, by allowing those with cancer to undergo very aggressive therapy. Many different specialists generally work together as a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a physician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist provides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any other non-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation. The oncologist often serves as the primary physician and coordinates the patient’s treatment plan. The radiation oncologist specializes in using radia- tion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performs the operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer.\n",

After this he went on to become a director himself. The Han-era family was patrilineal and typically had four to five nuclear family members living in one household. Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties. According to Confucian family norms, various family members were treated with different levels of respect and intimacy. For example, there were different accepted time frames for mourning the death of a father versus a paternal uncle. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered more important than the mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce their spouses and remarry.\n",

Multiple generations of extended family members did not occupy the same house, unlike families of later dynasties.
